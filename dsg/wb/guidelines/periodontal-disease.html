The waiting times after treatment are to allow healing and for any bacteria that have entered the blood stream to be cleared.</p>


<p><br />
Gum disease is common. Symptoms include pain, swelling, ulcers and difficulty eating. Donors may declare that they have gingivitis which is inflammation of the gums and which may be acute or chronic, but more chronic or extensive inflammation is usually called periodontal disease. If left untreated, disease can spread to the underlying bones causing teeth to become lose and/or require removal.</p>


<p><br />
Referral to a periodontal specialist may be required, but active significant gum disease will usually be managed to prevent progression, by frequent visits to a dentist or dental hygienist for a course of intensive deep cleaning. Once this course of periodontal treatment is completed then the usual regular schedule of dental hygienist cleaning three-monthly to maintain gum health will resume and continue. Gum disease can be associated with e.g. diabetes or pregnancy, and so care must be taken to ensure a donor is also otherwise eligible.</p>


<p><br />
As there may be uncertainty about infection risks for invasive dental treatment performed outside the UK and ROI, a deferral period of three months is required. Invasive treatments include root canal treatments, dental capping, dental implants and tooth extractions.</p>


<p><br />
Graft materials used in dental procedures are highly processed products, derived from autologous bone, other human bone (allogeneic), animal bone or non-biological materials.</p>


<p><br />
In the UK and ROI, any animal-derived graft material used in dental treatment are approved by regulatory authorities and can be regarded as free from known infection risks. If the donor knows that they received a product derived from an animal, or non-biological) source, the donor can be accepted. If the donor is unsure, advise them to check with their dentist.</p>


<p><br />
For dental surgery performed elsewhere in the world, it may be necessary to request more information about any graft products which were used.</p>


<p><br />
Donors who have had more extensive surgery on their jaw may have received a standard human bone graft.
