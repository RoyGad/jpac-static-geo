<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Active hepatitis B infection</strong> refers to an individual with circulating HBsAg and/or HBV DNA. This term includes acute and chronic hepatitis B infection.<br />
<strong>Recovered hepatitis B</strong> infection refers to an individual who was previously diagnosed with hepatitis B infection but has subsequently cleared HBV from their circulation.<br />
<strong>Current exposure</strong> refers to an individual who has recent household or sexual contact with an individual with active or recovered hepatitis B infection. ‘Recent’ is defined as the last 4 months for household contacts or the last 3 months for sexual contacts.<br />
<strong>Previous exposure</strong> refers to an individual who has been a household contact more than 4 months ago, or a sexual contact more than 3 months ago, of someone with active or recovered hepatitis B infection.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The longer time period specified for household contact is a requirement of the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations (BSQR).</p>

Individuals who have recovered from hepatitis B will remain anti-HBc positive. There is a risk that reactivation of hepatitis B virus in such an individual could give rise to occult hepatitis B infection which is not detected by routine testing. For this reason, donors who are anti-HBc positive are deferred from donation.</p>


<p><br />
SaBTO included in their recommendations a discretion that anti-HBc positive donors could be accepted if (1) they have adequate immunity to HBV, as demonstrated by an anti-HBs result of greater than 100 iu/l in a validated assay within 24 months of donation and (2) all of their donations will be tested by individual HBV DNA testing. UK Blood Transfusion Services are not currently implementing this approach. These guidelines will be revised should any service implement this additional testing at a future date.</p>


<p><br />
It is likely that donors who are anti-HBc negative have not had hepatitis B in the past. They do not require any additional testing once the diagnosis of hepatitis B has been excluded.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="data-sub" colspan="2"><table class="data-sub-table"><tbody><tr><td class="data-header" colspan="2">2.

If the sexual or household contact has no history of hepatitis B but has been told they are anti-HBc positive, indicating previous infection only, it is likely that several months have elapsed since the contact cleared the virus from their circulation.
