This happened with hepatitis C.<br />
<br />
Transfusions in some countries may have put the donor at risk of malaria or South American trypanosomiasis. It is necessary to exclude these infections before accepting the donor.<br />
<br />
<b>Coagulation concentrates:</b><br />
People who have received blood derived coagulation concentrates (these are made from the blood of many donors) may have been put at risk of infections that can be passed through blood.<br />
<br />
<b>Donors transfused since 1980:</b><br />
In the autumn of 2003 a UK recipient of blood, taken from a healthy donor who later developed variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), died from vCJD. Since then there have been several cases of infection with the vCJD prion in recipients of blood from donors who have later developed vCJD. In view of this, people transfused, or possibly transfused, since 1980 are now excluded from donation. This date is before Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is believed to have caused vCJD, was prevalent.<br />
<br />
Plasma exchange results in a patient being exposed to multiple donors. In view of the increased vCJD risk, donations may not be taken from individuals who have had a plasma exchange performed since 1980.<br />
<br />
<b>Donors transfused before 1996 (Infected Blood Inquiry):</b><br />
The Infected Blood Inquiry (2024) recommended that anyone who received a transfusion before 1996 should be offered hepatitis C testing, unless they have already been tested.<br />
<br />
Advise the donor to discuss/seek testing for hepatitis C with their GP or another clinical service if:</p>


<ul>
	<li>they were transfused before 1996, and</li>
	<li>they are currently deferred from donating blood, and</li>
	<li>they haven't been tested for hepatitis C by a health care provider since, and</li>
	<li>they haven't donated blood since the start of 1996.</li>
</ul>


<p><br />
Donors who are accepted to donate do not need to see their GP as their blood will be tested as part of routine blood donation screening.</p></td></tr><tr class="data-row"><td class="data-label">Information</td><td class="data-value"><p>This entry reflects guidance from SaBTO (Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs) and its predecessor, the Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Blood Tissues and Organs of the Department of Health.</p></td></tr><tr class="data-row"><td class="data-label">Reason for change</td><td class="data-value"><p>Addition of guidance for the management of previously-deferred donors, following the recommendation of the Infected Blood Inquiry (2024) regarding hepatitis C testing.</p></td></tr><tr class="data-row"><td class="data-label">Donor Information</td><td class="data-value"><p>If you wish to obtain more information regarding a personal medical issue, please contact your <a href="../../../dsg/wb/guidelines/nn099-national-help-lines.html">National Help Line</a>.<br />
