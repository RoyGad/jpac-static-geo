<p><br />
Some deficiencies cause significant bleeding, either spontaneously or in response to even minimal trauma or minor procedures. Individuals will have been assessed and advised about their condition and bleeding risk. They may have received treatment or been informed regarding the need for treatment in the future. The donor may have also been provided with a Bleeding Disorders Information Card.</p>


<p><br />
Some people with the carrier state (trait) may be at risk of bleeding (symptomatic carriers). The diagnosis of the milder forms or carrier status of coagulation factor deficiencies may arise from family screening, or through testing during investigation for menorrhagia (heavy periods), or bleeding during pregnancy or childbirth.</p>


<p><br />
If someone has had problems with bleeding or bruising, they may be at increased risk of complications from donation.</p>


<p><br />
The guidance contained in this entry is not intended for use for donors without a coagulation factor deficiency, for example for someone who may have taken tranexamic acid for heavy periods due to an underlying gynaecological cause.</p>


<p><br />
The current International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) classification recognises three types of Von Willebrand Disease: Type 1 is a partial quantitative deficiency of Von Willebrand Factor and is typically a milder form; the levels of von Willebrand Factor may overlap with the levels found in unaffected individuals.</p>


<p><br />
More severe effects are usually seen with Von Willebrand Disease types 2 and 3. Care should be taken to determine the type of Von Willebrand Disease, as only donors with type 1 are potentially eligible.</p></td></tr><tr class="data-row"><td class="data-label">Information</td><td class="data-value"><p>Part of this entry is a requirement of the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td class="data-sub" colspan="2"><table class="data-sub-table"><tbody><tr><td class="data-header" colspan="2">2.

<br />
Many bleeding disorders are inherited. Family members that are blood relations may be affected by the bleeding disorder. They could be at risk of excessive bleeding or bruising. Most close blood relations would have been screened by a haematologist from whom additional information may be available.<br />
<br />
Waiting three or four months from the last sexual contact or inoculation injury helps to ensure that the infections tested for by the Blood and Tissues Services will be picked up.&nbsp;</p>
